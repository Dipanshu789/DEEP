### 📱 **Prompt to Generate Smart Attendance Mobile App (Secure & Modern)**

> **Prompt:**
>
> Design a **secure, corruption-free smart attendance mobile app UI** with a clean, modern interface (rounded cards, soft shadows, smooth transitions, blue-white tones, minimal icons, responsive layout). Build the following screens and flows with a futuristic but user-friendly style:
>
> ---
>
> ### 🔄 1. **Loading Screen**
>
> * Full-screen logo splash animation with progress bar or spinner
>
> ### 👋 2. **Welcome Page**
>
> * Two large buttons: **Login** | **Signup**
> * Single screen handles login/signup for both user and admin
> * Floating tabs or toggle switch between login and register form
> * Form fields: Email, Password (with password visibility toggle), Confirm Password (for signup)
>
> ### 🙍 3. **Post-Login/Signup: Role Selection Page**
>
> * Clean screen with two cards/buttons:
>
>   * `👤 I am a User`
>   * `🛠️ I am an Admin`
> * After selection, navigate to face registration
>
> ### 🎥 4. **Face Registration Page (For Both Roles)**
>
> * Camera access with live preview
> * UI to guide face capture with liveness detection (e.g., "Blink", "Turn left", etc.)
> * Progress bar (e.g., 3/5 face samples collected)
> * "Register Face" CTA button
> * Upon success: animated checkmark + continue button
>
> ---
>
> ### 👨‍💼 5. **After Face Registration – Role-Based Navigation**
>
> #### 🧑‍💼 If **User**:
>
> * Navigate to **Company Code Page**
> * Placeholder: "Enter your company code"
> * Button: "Next"
>
> #### 👩‍💼 If **Admin**:
>
> * Navigate to **Company Login Page**
> * Placeholder 1: "Enter your company code"
> * Placeholder 2: "Enter your company password"
> * Button: "Login to Company"
> * Below: Small text link → `"New Admin? Register Company"`
>
> ---
>
> ### 🏢 6. **Register Company Page (Admin Only)**
>
> * Form fields:
>
>   * Company Name
>   * Company Email
>   * Number of Employees
>   * Create Company Code
>   * Create Company Password
> * Button: "Register Company"
> * On success: Automatically redirect to **Company Login Page**
>
> ---
>
> ### 🎨 UI/UX Notes:
>
> * Use modern fonts (e.g., Inter, Poppins)
> * Use soft blue/white/gray palette
> * Rounded components (12–16px radius), neumorphic or glassmorphism style
> * Use Lottie animations for success or transitions
> * Mobile-first responsive layout, smooth transitions between screens
> * Icons: Lucide or Feather icons for clean design
>
> Ensure navigation is **seamless**, and security elements (e.g., password hiding, loading states, progress indicators) are **visibly present**. The role selection must act as a secure path split, and company validation must be emphasized with proper input handling and errors.
